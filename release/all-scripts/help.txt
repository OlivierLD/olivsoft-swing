+------------------+

J: CelestJava
==============
Some Java utilities for celestial navigation (almanac publishing)
This starts another menu, which will guide you.

C: GRIB, Faxes and Charts
=========================
Superimpose the faxes you've downloaded from SailMail, NOAA Web Site or any 
other source, superimpose them with charts, GRIB files, etc.
If you're connected to a GPS, you can also plot the boat's position.
Some routing capabilities are also available (work in progress).
This program comes with documentation, and on-line help.

L: Chart Library
================
A graphical utility, based on hypersonicSQL to arrange your chart library.

N: NMEA Logger/HttpServer
=========================
NMEA Data can be read from the GPS or Nav Station using the RS232 serial port.
This port has to be accessed exclusively, that means that when an application
uses it, it cannot be used by any other application.
This application is reading the NMEA data, and rebroadcasts then through http.
By default, on http://localhost:6666. That means that any number of other 
applications can reach the data through the http connection.
Start this application, and enter the URL mentioned above. Try also
http://localhost:6666/help for details.
This application also has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows you to 
visualize what's read, as well as the validity of the NMEA sentences.
The sentences to read have to be mentionned in the file named nmea.properties.
Use notepad or any text editor to modify it.
This utility can also log the selected NMEA Sentence, for further analysis.

M: Minimal NMEA Viewer
======================
Same as above, without http broadcasting or logging capability.
This is designed to see what the NMEA device is spitting out.
It displays everything, no reference to nmea.properties is made.

G: NMEA Logger/HttpServer (simulation)
======================================
Simulates the option N, data are read from a file (nmea.txt by default).
You don't need to be connected to a GPS or any Nav Station.

S: Minimal NMEA Server
======================
Same as N, but with no GUI. Reads and rebroadcast the NMEA Sentences mentioned 
in nmea.properties. The http port is mentioned in the command line (edit 
olivsoft.bat to modify it if necessary).

X: Stop the minimal NMEA Server
===============================
Cleanly stops the above, option S.

B: GRIB BatchClient
====================
This one is to run on a desktop that stays on all the time.
It will periodically download faxes from a Web Site (like NOAA), GRIB, or any 
resources.
This will allow you to build your own "live" Pilot Charts...
See how it is called by editing olivsoft.bat.

E: GRIB Email Client
====================
When connected to the internet, you can send your own email request to SailDocs
and get the requested GRIB File from the same UI.
You can prepare your own GRIB Request in a file named gribrequests.properties.
The properties of your email server and account have to be placed in a file 
named gribmail.properties.

F: SailFax (SkedFile.txt)
=========================
GetFax can be automated, to download specific faxes from specific stations
at some specific time. The data driving GetFax have to be stored in a file
named SkedFile.txt, stored in the same directory as GetFax.
This program provides a Graphical User Interface to generate this file
in a user friendly way.
The generated file then has to be copied in the GetFax directory, see
option K.
The data displayed in this application are stored in XML format, in the
file named pac-fax-data.xml. The file name is a parameter mentioned at 
runtime (see line 37 of olivsoft.bat). For now, we provide only data
for the Pacific Ocean. We will provide more later. Feel free to build your
own data for your own navigation zone, and let me know!
The XML Schema this file has to comply with is also provided, and named
fax-data-v2.xsd.

P: Printable Fax Schedule
=========================
Print the fax schedule after generated the above.

D: DOS Prompt
=============
Opens a DOS Window in the directory you're reading this from.

K: SkedFile.txt to SailMail
===========================
Pushes the file SkedFIle.txt into the GetFax directory, atfer you've edited it
with the option F. For the file to be copied in the right place, you have to 
edit and modify olivsoft.bat, line 63.

Z: SkedFile.txt from SailMail
=============================
Pulls the file SkedFIle.txt from the GetFax directory, before you edit it
with the option F. For the file to be copied from the right place, you have to 
edit and modify olivsoft.bat, line 65.

H: Generic Help
===============
Displays the current document, help.txt.

Q: Quit
=======
Exit the menu.
